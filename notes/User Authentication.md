# User Authentication

## Backend

I've created some basic authentication routes and controllers to handle user registration, login, logout and password reset.

### Login

The login route is handled by Laravel Sanctum and will return a Sanctum token which is used to authenticate the user on the frontend.

### Register

The register route is handled by Laravel and will create a new user in the database however this area is incomplete and does not currently send a verification email to the user. Please use the user we have set in the README
